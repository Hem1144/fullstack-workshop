# Pairing with git

## Getting started
You and your partner should follow these instructions together. PartnerA will assume the role of "driver" first, and PartnerB will assume the role of "navigator" first - decide now who those will be. You should switch these roles every ~15 minutes (use a timer to keep track).

The steps below will help you establish a workflow for sharing your work with each other using Git. Note that for this to work, it is very important that only one partner works on the project at a time - you must stick to the driver/navigator roles.

- Both partners should fork the repo and clone their fork to their respective machines.
- **PartnerA (driver first)**: Copy the url for your fork's github page from your browser's url bar (it will be something like `https://github.com/<driver_username>/<PairExercise.WorkshopTitle>`) and send that url to your partner via Slack
- **PartnerB (navigator first)**: Copy the url that your partner sent you, `cd` into your local clone on your machine and execute this command using that url (replace the `partner_name` with your partner's name, and `partner_github_url` with the url the driver sent you):
```bash
git remote add partner_name partner_github_url
```
- Repeat the two steps above, swapping driver and navigator
- Both partners should read the `README.md` of the project (separately)
- Once both partners have read the `README.md`, **start the pairing timer** and complete the workshop steps in order

## When it's time to switch roles
- The driver should commit all of their work and push it to their master branch of the project directory:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "A lovely commit message"
git push origin master
```
- The navigator should then **pull** from **their partner's remote** (NOT from their own origin) in their project directory:
```bash
git pull partner_name master
```
- Once the navigator completes the pull, they will have all of the driver's work, and you will both be ready to continue with roles reversed. When the time comes to switch again, you simply perform the same process (with roles reversed).
